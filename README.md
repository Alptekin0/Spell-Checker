# Spell-Checker
Detect spelling mistakes in Turkish texts and fixes them
This project used Zemberek dataset and coded in python
But the Zemberek dataset is java-based That's why we used Zemberek's gRPC service
This allowed us to send efficient, fast and error-free requests over protocols.
At the same time, only the normalization module of the Zemberek dataset was used
Because it is a sufficient module for spell checking and correction. (Normalization;	zemberek-normalization:	Basic spell checker, word suggestion. Noisy text normalization.)


All necessary explanations have been made in the code.
